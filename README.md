## About
This is intended to be a public collection of articles and research related to
quantitative text analysis. Please feel free to issue pull requests if you want to
contribute. 

## Contribute

If you want to add an article follow these steps:

1. Search in [`syllabus.md`](syllabus.md) if the citation already exists.
2. Fork the repository.
3. Add the citation in [bibtex format](http://www.bibtex.org/Format/) to
   [`bibliography.bib`](bibliography.bib). If you want your entry to show up
   under a certain category, add the following field to your bibtex entry: `category={<YOUR CATEGORY>}`.
   The category you put in does not have to match the existing ones. Feel free to create new ones. If you
   have a link to the resource add the field `link={YOUR WEBLINK}` to your
   entry. Please add only links that contain free (and legal) access to the
   resource.
4. (Optional) run [`parse_bib.py`](parse_bib.py) to generate the
   updated [`syllabus.md'](syllabus.md). If you don't do this step your entry will
   only show up in [`syllabus.md`](syllabus.md) after I (or someone else) updated it.
5. Issue a pull request.

Thank you!
